Hello everyone! 👋 I'm Bernardo, a Senior Data Engineer at Maersk and a student of the Data Science & Big Data Analytics master's degree program at TheValley. 🎓

💻 I have been working in the data field for over 10 years, which has led me to work for large companies such as BBVA, Santander Bank, and Maersk, and to live in and get to know cities such as Malaga, Madrid, and Boston!. I am also a certified Scrum Master and an advocate of agile. I studied computer engineering in Malaga and Ireland, and I am currently working on an exciting project within Maersk to optimize quay planning. 🚢

🛠️ I have an advanced level of expertise in T-SQL and query tuning, as well as an advanced level in Azure data technologies (Azure SQL, Azure Table Storage, Blob Storage, Azure Data Factory). I also have an intermediate to advanced level in Terraform for infrastructure creation and YAML for automated workflows. Currently, I am learning Python, so my level is beginner. 🐍

📧 If you would like to contact me, you can do so by email at b_palenciano_vizcaino@hotmail.com. 📩

In my free time, I am passionate about football (soccer) ⚽️, personal finance 💰, and hiking 🥾.
